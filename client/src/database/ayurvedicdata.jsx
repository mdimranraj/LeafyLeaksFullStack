The aromatic-medicinal plant Ocimum sanctum, is a member of the Lamiaceae family and belongs to the genus Ocimum. The plant is widely dispersed and cultivated in India and is endemic to the old-world tropics. Hindus in India hold tulsi in high regard and importance for ceremonial purposes. It has the honour of taking first place among all the accessories needed for all religious, familial, and public events like weddings, festivals, and Sraddha ceremonies (religious function performed after cremation). The usage of Tulsi in these rituals dates back in time as attested by the ancient Indian texts, which are being used today in India. ",

        howToGrow : "Plant seeds outdoors when the temperature is between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (late spring or early summer) (15-21 C). Sow the seeds indoors in a greenhouse or on a warm, sunny windowsill for a head start in the spring. Tamp down the tulsi seeds to ensure good soil-seed contact before covering them with a thin layer of compost or soil (about 1/4 inch). Place the seeds where they will receive warmth, light shade, and some morning sun. Spray the seeds with a sprayer. Up until the germination takes place, which will take about 1-2 weeks, keep the soil consistently moist.When the seedlings have grown two or three sets of true leaves, transplant them carefully in individual containers or outdoors, taking care not to disturb the roots.",
